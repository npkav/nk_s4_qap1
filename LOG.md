### v0.1 - 2025-05-23 
Hands-on with IntelliJ for the first time with this project. Loving how intuitive it feels, but definitely a bit out of my comfort zone.

- Created base Maven project
- Initial Commit

### v0.1.1 - 2025-05-23
Intent is to establish an organized boilerplate structure to build the app on. Creating packages instead of directories threw me off, but I like the change.

- Created packages for the tracker app as well as the cli, model, repo, and service layers.
