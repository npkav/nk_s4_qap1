# Dev Log

---

This isn't really just a changelog so much as a developer log, wherein I'm aiming to keep tabs on my habits and process
in order to review and reflect. Probably fine to ignore unless you're wondering why I made some ghastly decision in
the code; in which case it's probably a decent reference.
